        <Title>Qualification test for Wikipedia evidence finding task</Title>
        <Text>Welcome to this evidence finding task. You must select a minimal set of sentences from a short passage from Wikipedia that provide evidence to say whether a claim (a short factual statement) is true or false.

Guidelines:
        </Text>
        <List>
            <ListItem>Please only select sentences that are necessary for you to form a judgement (either by combining some sentences together or a set of sentences that each individually substantiate the claim).</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Sentences that do not provide evidence to say whether a claim is true or false should not be selected (see example 1)</ListItem>
            <ListItem>If a sentence refers to an object using a pronoun (it, he, she, they, etc), you must also select evidence that that describes what the pronoun refers to (see example 2). If the meaning of the pronoun in a sentence cannot be resolved from selecting an extra sentence, it is not evidence.</ListItem>
            <ListItem>Some sentences have more than one sentence that supports the claim equally well. Select all sentences that are evidence (example 3).</ListItem>
            <ListItem>A simple way to check whether a sentence is 'evidence' is to ask yourself "without this sentence, would my opinion whether the claim is true or false change?". If yes, the sentence would be evidence. If no, then do not include the sentence</ListItem>
            <ListItem>You use only the information we provide to inform your decision. You MUST NOT use any external resources such as a search engine or an external Wikipedia page.  </ListItem>

            <Text>
                Neither of these sentence express information about requiring a visa in Andorra - they should not be selected. While the second sentence discusses border control, there is no mention of visa enforcement.

                The second sentence is evidence and should be highlighted. Because this sentence starts with "the album", the first sentence must also be highlighted as this is needed to infer the meaning of "the album".
