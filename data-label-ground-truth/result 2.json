      "text": "There are some methods to produce transgenic fungi most of them being analogous to those used for plants.\nHowever, fungi have to be treated differently due to some of their microscopic and biochemical traits:\n* A major issue is the dikaryotic state that parts of some fungi are in; dikaryotic cells contain two haploid nuclei, one of each parent fungus.\nIf only one of these gets transformed, which is the rule, the percentage of transformed nuclei decreases after each sporulation.\n* Fungal cell walls are quite thick hindering DNA uptake so (partial) removal is often required; complete degradation, which is sometimes necessary, yields protoplasts.\n* Mycelial fungi consist of filamentous hyphae, which are, if at all, separated by internal cell walls interrupted by pores big enough to enable nutrients and organelles, sometimes even nuclei, to travel through each hypha.\nAs a result, individual cells usually cannot be separated.\nThis is problematic as neighbouring transformed cells may render untransformed ones immune to selection treatments, e.g. by delivering nutrients or proteins for antibiotic resistance.\n* Additionally, growth (and thereby mitosis) of these fungi exclusively occurs at the tip of their hyphae which can also deliver issues.\nAs stated earlier, an array of methods used for plant transformation do also work in fungi:\n* Agrobacterium is not only capable of infecting plants but also fungi, however, unlike plants, fungi do not secrete the phenolic compounds necessary to triggger Agrobacterium so that they have to be added e.g. in the form of acetosyringone.\n* Thanks to development of an expression system for small RNAs in fungi the introduction of a CRISPR/CAS9-system in fungal cells became possible.\nIn 2016 the USDA declared that it will not regulate a white button mushroom strain edited with CRISPR/CAS9 to prevent fruit body browning causing a broad discussion about placing CRISPR/CAS9-edited crops on the market."

They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit\".\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments\".\nRoeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\".\nGleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".\nMcCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\".\nGleiberman also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"Infinity War brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality\".\nMcCarthy called the scale of the action \"astonishing\", and Travers wrote, \"Avengers: Infinity War leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes\".\nJosh Spiegel, also of The Hollywood Reporter, said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of The Empire Strikes Back in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids\"."

At the time I was playing tennis at the Malibu Racquet Club and I was approached by some producers about doing a Redd Foxx 50th Anniversary Special. I hadn’t spoken to him since 1977, and I called the club where (Redd) was playing. And we met at Redd’s office, but he was less than affable. I told those guys it was a bad idea. I never had a cross word with him. People say I’m protective of Redd Foxx in my book (Second Banana, Wilson’s memoir of the Sanford years). I had no animosity toward Foxx for (quitting the show in 1977) because I had a million dollar contract at CBS to do Baby... I'm Back!. My hurt was that he didn’t come to me about throwing the towel in - I found out in the hallway at NBC from a newscaster. I forgave him and I loved Redd, but I never forgot that. The love was there. You can watch any episode and see that\".\nWilson also appeared in the films Full Moon High (1981), Me and the Kid (1993), and Hammerlock (2000)."

      "text": "After director Danny Boyle and producer Andrew Macdonald filmed an adaptation of Alex Garland's novel The Beach, Garland approached Macdonald about his concept for 28 Days Later.\nIn an interview with Creative Screenwriting, Garland explained, \"I said to him that I had an idea for a movie about running zombies. I wrote it and sent it to him and the two of us went backwards and forwards with it for a few drafts... At the point I was working on 28 Days Later I had a lot of zombie movies as well as video games like Resident Evil turning round in my head\".\nEarly influences on Garland included the George Romero films Night of the Living Dead (1968) and Dawn of the Dead (1978), which he loved as a child, but he said he had largely forgotten about the zombie genre until he played the video game Resident Evil (1996), which reminded him how much he loved zombies after \"having not really encountered zombies for quite a while\".\n28 Days Later features scenes set in normally bustling parts of London such as Westminster Bridge, Piccadilly Circus, Horse Guards Parade and Oxford Street.\nTo depict these locations as desolate, the film crew closed off sections of street for minutes at a time, usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays and would have typically around 45 minutes after dawn, to shoot the locations devoid of traffic and members of the public – to minimise disruption.\nPortions of the film were shot on a Canon XL1 digital video camera.\nDV cameras are much smaller and more manoeuvrable than traditional film cameras, which would have been impractical on such brief shoots.\nThe scenes of the M1 motorway devoid of traffic were also filmed within very limited time periods.\nA mobile police roadblock slowed traffic sufficiently, to leave a long section of carriageway empty while the scene was filmed.\nThe section depicted in the film was filmed at Milton Keynes, nowhere near Manchester.\nFor the London scene where Jim walks by the overturned double-decker bus, the film crew placed the bus on its side and removed it when the shot was finished, all within 20 minutes.\nMuch of the filming took place prior to the 11 September attacks and in the audio commentary, Boyle notes the parallel between the \"missing persons\" flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks.\nBoyle adds that his crew probably would not have been granted permission to close off Whitehall for filming after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.\nA clapperboard seen in one of the DVD extra features shows filming was still taking place on 8 October 2001.\nThe mansion used in the film was Trafalgar Park near Salisbury.\nMany rooms in the house, including the Cipriani-painted music room and the main hall, were filmed with minimal set decoration.\nThe scenes occurring upstairs were filmed downstairs, as the mansion's owner resided upstairs.\nThe old ruins used as the setting for an idyllic interlude in their journey to Manchester, were those of Waverley Abbey, Surrey.\nThe end scenes of the film where Jim, Selena and Hannah are living in a rural cottage were filmed around Ennerdale in Cumbria.\nThis reflects the motorway road signage in the film which indicates the trio heading north towards the Lake District National Park.\nOn the DVD commentary, Boyle and Garland frequently call it a post apocalypse and horror film, commenting on scenes that were quotation of George A. Romero's Dead trilogy.\nDuring the initial marketing of the film Boyle did try to distance the film from such labels."

A new base in Destin/Fort Walton Beach will allow us to better serve travelers..\".\n. In May 2018, Allegiant Air established a full-time, year-round base there, serving 22 cities with direct service on Airbus A320 aircraft.\nIn 2008 the FAA recorded over 373,808 enplanements at the airport."

      "text": "Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause of the Black Death, many Europeans ascribed supernatural forces, earthquakes and malicious conspiracies, among other things, as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.\nNo one in the 14th century considered rat control a way to ward off the plague, and people began to believe only God's anger could produce such horrific displays of suffering and death.\nGiovanni Boccaccio, an Italian writer and poet of the era, questioned whether it was sent by God for their correction, or that it came through the influence of the heavenly bodies.\nChristians accused Jews of poisoning public water supplies in an effort to ruin European civilization.\nThe spreading of this rumor led to complete destruction of entire Jewish towns, and was simply caused by suspicion on part of the Christians, who noticed that the Jews had lost fewer lives to the plague due to their hygienic practices.\nIn February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in Strasbourg.\nIn August of the same year, the Jewish communities of Mainz and Cologne were murdered.\nWhere government authorities were concerned, most monarchs instituted measures that prohibited exports of foodstuffs, condemned black market speculators, set price controls on grain, and outlawed large-scale fishing.\nAt best, they proved mostly unenforceable.\nAt worst, they contributed to a continent-wide downward spiral.\nThe hardest hit lands, like England, were unable to buy grain abroad from France because of the prohibition and from most of the rest of the grain producers because of crop failures from shortage of labour.\nAny grain that could be shipped was eventually taken by pirates or looters to be sold on the black market.\nMeanwhile, many of the largest countries, most notably England and Scotland, had been at war, using up much of their treasury and exacerbating inflation.\nIn 1337, on the eve of the first wave of the Black Death, England and France went to war in what would become known as the Hundred Years' War.\nMalnutrition, poverty, disease and hunger, coupled with war, growing inflation and other economic concerns made Europe in the mid-14th century ripe for tragedy.\nEurope had been overpopulated before the plague, and a reduction of 30 to 50 percent of the population could have resulted in higher wages and more available land and food for peasants because of less competition for resources.\nHistorian Walter Scheidel contends that waves of plague following the initial outbreak of the Black Death had a leveling effect that changed the ratio of land to labour, reducing the value of the former while boosting that of the latter, which lowered economic inequality by making landowners and employers less well off while improving the lot of the workers.\nHe states that \"the observed improvement in living standards of the laboring population was rooted in the suffering and premature death of tens of millions over the course of several generations\".\nThis leveling effect was reversed by a \"demographic recovery that resulted in renewed population pressure\".\nIn 1357, a third of property in London was unused due to a severe outbreak in 1348–49.\nHowever, for reasons that are still debated, population levels declined after the Black Death's first outbreak until around 1420 and did not begin to rise again until 1470, so the initial Black Death event on its own does not entirely provide a satisfactory explanation to this extended period of decline in prosperity.\nSee Medieval demography for a more complete treatment of this issue and current theories on why improvements in living standards took longer to evolve."

      "text": "Internet memes grew as a concept in the mid-1990s.\nAt the time, memes were just short clips that were shared between people in Usenet forums.\nAs the Internet evolved, so did memes.\nWhen YouTube was released in 2005, video memes became popular.\nAround this time, rickrolling became popular and the link to this video was sent around via email or other messaging sites.\nVideo sharing also created memes such as \"Turn Down for What\" and the \"Harlem Shake\".\nAs social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook started appearing, it was now easy to share GIFs and image macros to a large audience.\nMeme generator websites were created to let users create their own memes out of existing templates.\nMemes during this time could remain popular for a long time, from a few months to a decade, which contrasts with the fast lifespan of modern memes.\nAn Internet meme may stay the same or may evolve over time, by chance or through commentary, imitations, parody, or by incorporating news accounts about itself.\nInternet memes can evolve and spread extremely rapidly, sometimes reaching worldwide popularity within a few days.\nInternet memes usually are formed from some social interaction, pop culture reference, or situations people often find themselves in.\nTheir rapid growth and impact has caught the attention of both researchers and industry.\nAcademically, researchers model how they evolve and predict which memes will survive and spread throughout the Web.\nCommercially, they are used in viral marketing where they are an inexpensive form of mass advertising.\nOne empirical approach studied meme characteristics and behavior independently from the networks in which they propagated, and reached a set of conclusions concerning successful meme propagation.\nFor example, the study asserted that Internet memes not only compete for viewer attention generally resulting in a shorter life, but also, through user creativity, memes can collaborate with each other and achieve greater survival.\nAlso, paradoxically, an individual meme that experiences a popularity peak significantly higher than its average popularity is not generally expected to survive unless it is unique, whereas a meme with no such popularity peak keeps being used together with other memes and thus has greater survivability.\nMultiple opposing studies on media psychology and communication have aimed to characterize and analyze the concept and representations in order to make it accessible for the academic research.\nThus, Internet memes can be regarded as a unit of information which replicates via the Internet.\nThis unit can replicate or mutate.\nThis mutation instead of being generational follows more a viral pattern, giving the Internet memes generally a short life.\nOther theoretical problems with the Internet memes are their behavior, their type of change, and their teleology.\nInternet memes have been examined by Dancygier and Vandelanotte in 2017 for aspects of cognitive linguistic and construction grammar.\nThe authors analyzed some selective popular image macros like, Said no one ever, One does not simply, But that’s none of my business, and Good Girl Gina to draw attention to the constructionality, multimodality, viewpoint and intersubjectivity of these memes.\nThey further argued that with the combination of text and images, the internet memes can add to the functioning linguistic construction frame as well as create new linguistic constructions.\nWriting for The Washington Post in 2013, Dominic Basulto asserted that with the growth of the Internet and the practices of the marketing and advertising industries, memes have come to transmit fewer snippets of human culture that could survive for centuries as originally envisioned by Dawkins, and instead transmit banality at the expense of big ideas."

      "text": "The museum comprises two buildings: the West Building (1941) and the East Building (1978) linked by an underground passage.\nThe West Building, composed of pink Tennessee marble, was designed in 1937 by architect John Russell Pope in a neoclassical style (as is Pope's other notable Washington, D.C. building, the Jefferson Memorial).\nDesigned in the form of an elongated H, the building is centered on a domed rotunda modeled on the interior of the Pantheon in Rome.\nExtending east and west from the rotunda, a pair of skylit sculpture halls provide its main circulation spine.\nBright garden courts provide a counterpoint to the long main axis of the building.\nThe West Building has an extensive collection of paintings and sculptures by European masters from the medieval period through the late 19th century, as well as pre-20th century works by American artists.\nHighlights of the collection include many paintings by Jan Vermeer, Rembrandt van Rijn, Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, and Leonardo da Vinci.\nIn contrast, the design of the East Building by architect I. M. Pei is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one isosceles and the other a smaller right triangle.\nThe space defined by the isosceles triangle came to house the museum's public functions.\nThe portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center.\nThe triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.\nThe building's central feature is a high atrium designed as an open interior court that is enclosed by a sculptural space spanning 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2).\nThe atrium is centered on the same axis that forms the circulation spine for the West Building and is constructed in the same Tennessee marble.\nHowever, in 2005 the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk that panels might fall onto visitors below.\nIn 2008, NGA officials decided that it had become necessary to remove and reinstall all of the panels.\nThe renovation was completed in 2016.\nThe East Building focuses on modern and contemporary art, with a collection including works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Alexander Calder, a 1977 mural by Robert Motherwell and works by many other artists.\nThe East Building also contains the main offices of the NGA and a large research facility, Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA).\nAmong the highlights of the East Building in 2012 was an exhibition of Barnett Newman's The Stations of the Cross series of 14 black and white paintings (1958–66).\nNewman painted them after he had recovered from a heart attack; they are usually regarded as the peak of his achievement.\nThe series has also been seen as a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust.\nThe two buildings are connected by a walkway beneath 4th street, called \"the Concourse\" on the museum's map.\nIn 2008, the National Gallery of Art commissioned American artist Leo Villareal to transform the Concourse into an artistic installation.\nToday, Multiverse is the largest and most complex light sculpture by Villareal featuring approximately 41,000 computer-programmed LED nodes that run through channels along the entire 200-foot (61 m)-long space.\nThe concourse also includes the food court and a gift shop.\nThe final element of the National Gallery of Art complex, the Sculpture Garden was completed in 1999 after more than 30 years of planning.\nTo the west of the West Building, on the opposite side of Seventh Street, the 6.1 acres (2.5 ha) Sculpture Garden was designed by landscape architect Laurie Olin as an outdoor gallery for monumental modern sculpture.\nThe Sculpture Garden contains plantings of Native American species of canopy and flowering trees, shrubs, ground covers, and perennials.\nA circular reflecting pool and fountain form the center of its design, which arching pathways of granite and crushed stone complement.\n(The pool becomes an ice-skating rink during the winter)."

      "text": "When Weir wrote the novel The Martian, he strove to present the science correctly and used reader feedback to get it right.\nWhen Scott began directing the film, he also sought to make it realistic and received help from James L. Green, the Director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA's Science Mission Directorate.\nGreen put together teams to answer scientific questions that Scott asked.\nGreen said, \"The Martian is reasonably realistic\", though he said the film's hazardous dust storm, despite reaching speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h) would in reality have weak force.\nGreen also found the NASA buildings in the film to be more stylish than the functional ones NASA actually uses.\nFilm critics picked up the point that the Martian winds could amount to \"barely a light breeze\" in their reviews, and screenwriter Goddard agreed the winds had to be considerably exaggerated in order to set up the situation that sets the story in motion.\nThe process used by the character Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover.\nThe radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat.\nWhen his rations begin to run low, Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew's feces as a fertilizer.\n\"We could probably grow something on Mars\", said Michael Shara, curator, Department of Astrophysics, Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History.\nHowever Martian soil has since been found to be toxic to both plant and animal life, although it is believed that microbial organisms have the potential to live on Mars.\nIn one scene, the glass face shield on Watney's helmet cracks; as oxygen momentarily drops below the critical level, he quickly patches the helmet with duct tape and avoids suffocation.\nAccording to Shara, \"As long as the pressure on the inside is around 30%, you could hold it together before your eyes blow out or you had an embolism\".\nWhile Martian gravity is less than 40% of Earth's, director Scott chose not to depict the gravitational difference, finding the effort less worthwhile to put on screen than zero gravity.\nScott said the heavy spacesuits would weigh the main character enough to make up for not showing the partial gravity.\nThe climate of Mars is also cold enough that it would make Watney's initial plan to disable the rover's heater immediately impractical.\nThe average temperature is −80 °F (−62 °C); it is cold enough on Mars for carbon dioxide snow to fall at the poles in winter.\nThe plot key to the eventual rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work.\nIn reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice that has been used on a number of robotic planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions.\nIt would have been one of the first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.\nEd Finn, director of the Center for Science and the Imagination at Arizona State University, said, \"What this story does really well is imagine a near-future scenario that doesn't push too far of where we are today technically\"."

      "text": "In 1863, Abram Lyle, owner of a cooperage, became owner of the Glebe Sugar Refinery in Greenock, in lieu of a debt.\nHe became aware of the fact that a by-product of the sugar refining was a syrup which was usually sold off cheaply as pig-food.\nHe thought that, given some adjustment, this syrup could be adapted for human consumption.\nHis company did well and expanded to London.\nIn 1883, Charles Eastick, an English chemist at the Abram Lyle & Sons (now part of Tate & Lyle) refinery in Plaistow, east London, further formulated how sugar could be refined to make a preserve and sweetener for cooking, bringing it to its current recipe.\nCharles and his brother John Joseph Eastick experimented with the refining process, of the bitter molasses-brown treacle—hitherto a waste by-product of sugar refining—into an eminently palatable syrup with the viscosity, hue, and sweetness of honey.\nThe resulting product was marketed commercially in 1885 as \"golden syrup\".\nThe name \"golden syrup\" in connection with molasses had occurred, however, as early as 1840 in an Adelaide newspaper, the South Australian.\nThe tin bears a picture of the rotting carcass of a lion with a swarm of bees and the slogan \"Out of the strong came forth sweetness\".\nThis is a reference to the Biblical story in chapter 14 of the Book of Judges in which Samson was traveling to the land of the Philistines in search of a wife.\nDuring the journey he killed a lion, and when he passed the same spot on his return he noticed that a swarm of bees had formed a comb of honey in the carcass.\nSamson later turned this into a riddle at a wedding: \"Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness\".\nWhile it is not known exactly why this image and slogan were chosen, Abram Lyle was a deeply religious man, and it has been suggested that they refer either to the strength of the Lyle company or the tins in which golden syrup is sold.\nIn 1904, they were registered together as a trademark, and in 2006 Guinness World Records declared the mark to be the world's oldest branding and packaging.\nLyle's golden syrup was awarded a Royal Warrant in 1911.\nIn 1921, Lyle's business merged with Tate, a sugar-refining firm founded by Sir Henry Tate in 1859, to become Tate & Lyle.\nIn 2010, Tate & Lyle sold its sugar refining and golden syrup business to American Sugar Refining.\nOriginally, golden syrup was a product made at the white sugar refinery from the recovered mother liquor (recovered molasses) \"washed\" off the raw sugar crystals in the process of creating white sugar.\nThis liquor is generally known as refiners return syrup.\nToday most golden syrups are produced by a specialist manufacturer by inverting half the refiners return syrup to fructose and glucose and blending it back again; this ensures the product remains liquid and will never re-crystallize."

      "text": "The book, originally entitled Strangers from Within, was initially rejected by a reader at publishers Faber and Faber as \"Rubbish & dull. Pointless\".\nThe title was considered \"too abstract and too explicit\".\nFollowing a further review, the book was eventually published as Lord of the Flies.\nIn February 1960, Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction rated Lord of the Flies five stars out of five, stating that \"Golding paints a truly terrifying picture of the decay of a minuscule society ... Well on its way to becoming a modern classic\".\nIn his book Moral Minds: How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong, Marc D. Hauser says the following about Golding's Lord of the Flies: 'This riveting fiction, standard reading in most intro courses to English literature, should be standard reading in biology, economics, psychology, and philosophy'.\nIts stances on the already controversial subjects of human nature and individual welfare versus the common good earned it position 68 on the American Library Association's list of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 1900–1999.\nThe book has been criticized as \"cynical\" and portraying humanity exclusively as \"selfish creatures\".\nIt has been linked with \"Tragedy of the commons\" by Garrett Hardin and books by Ayn Rand, and countered by \"Management of the Commons\" by Elinor Ostrom.\nParallels have been drawn between the \"Lord of the Flies\" and actual incident from 1965 when a group of schoolboys who sailed a fishing boat from Tonga were hit by a storm and marooned on the uninhabited island of ʻAta, considered dead by their relatives in Nuku‘alofa.\nThe group not only managed to survive for over 15 months but \"had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination\".\nDutch historian Rutger Bregman, writing about this situation said that Golding's portrayal was unrealistic.\n* It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 41 on the editor's list, and 25 on the reader's list.\n* In 2003, the novel was listed at number 70 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\n* In 2005, the novel was chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.\nTime also included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.\nPopular in schools, especially in the English-speaking world, a 2016 UK poll saw Lord of the Flies ranked third in the nation's favourite books from school, behind George Orwell’s Animal Farm and Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations."

Adams said in June 2016, that the show was ending in 2017, as the couple has decided to get married after the show ends.\nFreeform gave out a statement not long after saying that \"There has been no official decision made for PLL beyond a season 7\".\nIt was announced on August 29, 2016, the day before the mid-season finale would air, that Pretty Little Liars will end after the seventh season."

Absent that, the series is essentially like a well-shot, brilliantly cast, fast-moving season of Homeland, which is better than the actual current season of Homeland\".\nIn a positive review, Variety's Maureen Ryan said that the show was an \"accessible, illuminating series that does not downplay the petty and tragic elements of the tale\".\nTime's Daniel D'Addario commended the show as \"a series that’s both gripping and relevant. It succeeds, with a project that restages the years before Sept. 11 and tells a darkly ironic story about the fecklessness of government\".\nIn a more negative review, Collider's Chris Cabin criticized the series calling it \"a middling act of didacticism, an attempt to pass off facts as insight and characters as little more than the sum of their intellect. Rather than tracing the complicated personalities and ludicrous dick-measuring contests that led to Al-Qaeda carrying out the biggest terrorist attack in American history, Gibney, Wright, and the rest of the creative team boil down the personal drama to little more than a series of arguments and discussions in offices at varying volumes\"."

But Handmaid's regains its footing by setting off on a new path\".\nDaniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a generally positive review, praising Elisabeth Moss' performance and the cinematography, but criticized the plot \"that has become frustratingly repetitive\".\nOverall, he wrote, \"Still occasionally powerful, but rarely as provocative\"."

      "text": "Environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest, and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming.\nAmazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems – of the order of 1.1 × 1011 metric tonnes of carbon.\nAmazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62 ± 0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996.\nOne computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the Amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures, leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100.\nHowever, simulations of Amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases.\nThe result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.\nIn 1989, environmentalist C.M. Peters and two colleagues stated there is economic as well as biological incentive to protecting the rainforest.\nOne hectare in the Peruvian Amazon has been calculated to have a value of $6820 if intact forest is sustainably harvested for fruits, latex, and timber; $1000 if clear-cut for commercial timber (not sustainably harvested); or $148 if used as cattle pasture.\nAs indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide, such as in the Peruvian Amazon indigenous peoples' rainforest communities continue to disappear, while others, like the Urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories.\nMeanwhile, the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland South American peoples has gained increased attention, as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts.\nFrom 2002 to 2006, the conserved land in the Amazon rainforest almost tripled and deforestation rates dropped up to 60%.\nAbout 1,000,000 km2 (250,000,000 acres) have been put onto some sort of conservation, which adds up to a current amount of 1,730,000 km2 (430,000,000 acres).\nIn April 2019, the Ecuadorian court stopped oil exploration activities in 1,800 square kilometers of the Amazon rainforest.\nIn July 2019, the Ecuadorian court forbade the government to sell territory with forests to oil companies.\nIn September 2019, the US and Brazil agreed to promote private-sector development in the Amazon.\nThey also pledged a $100m biodiversity conservation fund for the Amazon led by the private sector.\nBrazil's foreign minister stated that opening the rain-forest to economic development was the only way to protect it.\nA 2009 study found that a 4 °C rise (above pre-industrial levels) in global temperatures by 2100 would kill 85% of the Amazon rainforest while a temperature rise of 3 °C would kill some 75% of the Amazon.\nDeforestation in the Amazon rainforest region has a negative impact on local climate.\nIt was one of the main causes of the severe drought of 2014–2015 in Brazil.\nThis is because the moisture from the forests is important to the rainfall in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina."

Divide the range 2 through n into segments of some size Δ ≤ √n.\n2. Find the primes in the first (i.e. the lowest) segment, using the regular sieve.\n3. For each of the following segments, in increasing order, with m being the segment's topmost value, find the primes in it as follows:\n1. Set up a Boolean array of size Δ, and\n2. Eliminate from it the multiples of each prime p ≤ √m found so far, by calculating the lowest multiple of p between m \\- Δ and m, and enumerating its multiples in steps of p as usual, marking the corresponding positions in the array as non-prime.\nIf Δ is chosen to be √n, the space complexity of the algorithm is O(√n), while the time complexity is the same as that of the regular sieve."

      "text": "Captain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's Odyssey, a Greek epic poem.\nIn The Odyssey, Odysseus encounters the monstrous Cyclops Polyphemus in the course of his wanderings.\nPolyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that it's \"Utis\" (ουτις), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\".\nIn the Latin translation of the Odyssey, this pseudonym is rendered as \"Nemo\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\".\nLike Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and similarly grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury, an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the depths, and charted the world's oceans.\nMaury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, including Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; Dumont d'Urville, a later explorer who found the remains of one of Lapérouse's ships; and Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal and nephew of the sole survivor of Lapérouse's ill-fated expedition.\nThe Nautilus follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lapérouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the Astrolabe; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\nIn possibly the novel's most famous episode, the above-cited battle with a school of giant squid, one of the monsters captures a crew member.\nReflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of The Toilers of the Sea\".\nA bestselling novel in Verne's day, The Toilers of the Sea also features a threatening cephalopod: a laborer battles with an octopus, believed by critics to be symbolic of the Industrial Revolution.\nCertainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the Revolutions of 1848.\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics.\nMargaret Drabble, for instance, argues that Verne's masterwork also anticipated the ecology movement and influenced French avant-garde imagery.\nAs for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden.\nWhile in Mediterranean waters, the captain provides financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869, proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind.\nIn another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian pearl diver from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work.\nNemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself.\nIn the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a Polish nobleman, whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish January Uprising of 1863.\nHowever, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the insistence of Verne's publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts.\nAt the time France was a putative ally of the Russian Empire, hence Hetzel demanded that Verne suppress the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation.\nHetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins.\nEven so, a trace remains of the novel's initial concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion under a polish hero, Tadeusz Kościuszko, leader of the uprising against Russia and Prussia in 1794; Kościuszko mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"Poland is no more!\").\nFive years later, and again at Hetzel's insistence, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel The Mysterious Island.\nIt alters the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of Tipu Sultan, Muslim ruler of Mysore who resisted the expansionism of the British East India Company.\nThus Nemo's unnamed enemy is converted into France's old antagonist, the British Empire.\nBorn as an East Indian aristocrat, one Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the Indian Rebellion of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom.\nAfter his loved ones were slain by the British, Nemo fled beneath the seas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages.\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the earliest successful submarines, built in 1800 by Robert Fulton, who also invented the first commercially successful steamboat.\nFulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered nautilus.\nAs noted above, Verne also studied a model of the newly developed French Navy submarine Plongeur at the 1867 Exposition Universelle, which guided him in his development of the novel's Nautilus.\nThe diving gear used by passengers on the Nautilus is presented as a combination of two existing systems:1) the surface supplied hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes;2) a later, self-contained apparatus designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865.\nTheir invention featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand regulator.\nThe diver didn't swim but walked upright across the seafloor.\nThis device was called an aérophore (Greek for \"air-carrier\").\nIts air tanks could hold only thirty atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The Nautilus's pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours\"."

      "text": "A corporation must decide whether to introduce a new product line.\nThe company will have immediate costs of 100,000 at t = 0. Recall, a cost is a negative for outgoing cash flow, thus this cash flow is represented as −100,000.\nThe company assumes the product will provide equal benefits of 10,000 for each of 12 years beginning at t = 1. For simplicity, assume the company will have no outgoing cash flows after the initial 100,000 cost.\nThis also makes the simplifying assumption that the net cash received or paid is lumped into a single transaction occurring on the last day of each year.\nAt the end of the 12 years the product no longer provides any cash flow and is discontinued without any additional costs.\nAssume that the effective annual discount rate is 10%.\nThe present value (value at t = 0) can be calculated for each year:\nThe total present value of the incoming cash flows is 68,136.91.\nThe total present value of the outgoing cash flows is simply the 100,000 at time t = 0.\nThus:\nN P V = P V ( benefits ) − P V ( costs ) {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {NPV} =PV({\\text{benefits}})-PV({\\text{costs}})}\nIn this example:\nN P V = 68 , 136.91 − 100 , 000 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {NPV} =68,136.91-100,000}\nN P V = − 31 , 863.09 {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {NPV} =-31,863.09}\nObserve that as t increases the present value of each cash flow at t decreases.\nFor example, the final incoming cash flow has a future value of 10,000 at t = 12 but has a present value (at t = 0) of 3,186.31.\nThe opposite of discounting is compounding.\nTaking the example in reverse, it is the equivalent of investing 3,186.31 at t = 0 (the present value) at an interest rate of 10% compounded for 12 years, which results in a cash flow of 10,000 at t = 12 (the future value).\nThe importance of NPV becomes clear in this instance.\nAlthough the incoming cash flows (10,000 × 12 = 120,000) appear to exceed the outgoing cash flow (100,000), the future cash flows are not adjusted using the discount rate.\nThus, the project appears misleadingly profitable.\nWhen the cash flows are discounted however, it indicates the project would result in a net loss of 31,863.09.\nThus, the NPV calculation indicates that this project should be disregarded because investing in this project is the equivalent of a loss of 31,863.09 at t = 0.\nThe concept of time value of money indicates that cash flows in different periods of time cannot be accurately compared unless they have been adjusted to reflect their value at the same period of time (in this instance, t = 0).\nIt is the present value of each future cash flow that must be determined in order to provide any meaningful comparison between cash flows at different periods of time.\nThere are a few inherent assumptions in this type of analysis:\n1. The investment horizon of all possible investment projects considered are equally acceptable to the investor (e.g. a 3-year project is not necessarily preferable vs. a 20-year project).\n2. The 10% discount rate is the appropriate (and stable) rate to discount the expected cash flows from each project being considered.\nEach project is assumed equally speculative.\n3. The shareholders cannot get above a 10% return on their money if they were to directly assume an equivalent level of risk.\n(If the investor could do better elsewhere, no projects should be undertaken by the firm, and the excess capital should be turned over to the shareholder through dividends and stock repurchases).\nMore realistic problems would also need to consider other factors, generally including: smaller time buckets, the calculation of taxes (including the cash flow timing), inflation, currency exchange fluctuations, hedged or unhedged commodity costs, risks of technical obsolescence, potential future competitive factors, uneven or unpredictable cash flows, and a more realistic salvage value assumption, as well as many others.\nA more simple example of the net present value of incoming cash flow over a set period of time, would be winning a Powerball lottery of $500 million.\nIf one does not select the \"CASH\" option they will be paid $25,000,000 per year for 20 years, a total of $500,000,000, however, if one does select the \"CASH\" option, they will receive a one-time lump sum payment of approximately $285 million, the NPV of $500,000,000 paid over time.\nSee \"other factors\" above that could affect the payment amount.\nBoth scenarios are before taxes."

When Glenn accidentally grabs a box of condoms for Maggie to see, I chuckled heartily. The ensuing conversation also made me smile, which makes me wonder why humor is paid the least amount of attention on the show\".\nJackson was surprised with the scene, and called it \"unexpected\".\nIn the comic book and television mediums, Glenn is murdered by Negan, who uses his infamous barbwire bat \"Lucille\" to repeatedly bash his head in to a pulp as his wife and friends watch horrified, and helplessly after being captured by the Saviors.\nThere is a difference in how his death occurs: In the comic books, after being forced to their knees, Glenn was revealed to be the victim chosen outright to die.\nHowever, Abraham Ford received this fate on TV in the episode \"The Day Will Come When You Won't Be\".\nGlenn was still killed off in the same episode, with his demise being a result of Daryl Dixon disobeying Negan's rules.\nThe deaths led to significant debate regarding the direction of the show.\nSome viewers and critics saw the deaths as too violent, with a number of them stating that the show had gone too far or that they would stop watching it; others felt that Glenn's death was needed because it reflects the comic book version and that both deaths show how brutal Negan can be."

      "text": "The series' writers began work on the second season in December 2017, and were considering \"science vs. faith\" as the main theme of the season.\nHarberts said the season would be \"jam packed\" with things that they were not able to do in the first.\nIn March 2018, Harberts clarified that the series would not just be looking at religion, but also \"patterns in our lives. It means connections you can't explain. Who enters your life and who leaves your life and these indelible impressions people make ... that is one of our biggest ideas now and it is threading through all of our characters' lives\".\nSomething that Kurtzman felt \"all the best\" Star Trek series had was examinations of the real world at the time of their creation, and so this season would address \"building walls around ourselves, literally, to keep people out\" and how that can \"chip away at our essential understanding of Starfleet doctrine, and what it means to assume diversity\".\nMount felt that the season was able to \"get back to those big questions\" because it was no longer questioning the leadership of the Discovery as was done with Captain Gabriel Lorca in the first season.\nKurtzman noted that religion is a controversial topic among Star Trek fans, and the series' study of faith was \"never about picking on religion as much as it was about faith in each other and in themselves\".\nHe felt that protagonist Michael Burnham \"really wrestled\" with faith in the season because she was not raised with it, but in the end was rewarded for finding it.\nHe interpreted this message as being, \"If you believe in yourself, ultimately, the best outcome presents itself\".\nWithout the first season's Federation–Klingon War storyline, Kurtzman said there would be less focus on the Klingons in the second season and far fewer Klingon-only scenes, but Klingon characters would still appear.\nHe added that the Klingons would grow their hair back to show that they are no longer at war, something he said was always intended and not a response to fan criticisms of the bald Klingons in the first season.\nThe second season has a single serialized story like the first season had, but the writers moved towards a more episodic feel by having a central character or question for each episode.\nThe second season begins where the first season ended, with the arrival of the USS Enterprise.\nThis ties into a larger story that is the main arc for the second season, involving seven mysterious signals and a mysterious \"red angel\" figure.\nHarberts wanted to explore the character Christopher Pike, captain of the Enterprise, feeling that he had not been seen much in the franchise.\nBurnham's adoptive brother Spock is also a crew member of the Enterprise, but Harberts was less interested in him given his many appearances throughout the franchise.\nHarberts was also reluctant to have an actor other than Leonard Nimoy or Zachary Quinto portray the character.\nHowever, Spock was confirmed to be included in April 2018, and his relationship with Burnham became the most important part of the season for Kurtzman.\nThe writers wanted to tell a new story with Spock that would show him become closer to the Nimoy and Quinto versions over time, visually signified by having the character shave his beard at the end of the season to look more like them.\nThe season also reveals that it was Burnham's relationship with Spock that allowed him to \"fully actualize himself\" with James Kirk in the original Star Trek series, which was an important development for Kurtzman to explore when telling this part of Spock's life.\nThe season finale had to answer all the season's mysteries, complete its character arcs, feature a large battle, and set-up stories for the next season.\nWhile planning this, the writers realized that they could not do justice to it all within a single episode's length.\nIt was around this time that CBS added an additional episode to the season's order, which allowed the writers to expand their finale plans to a two-part season finale.\nExecutive producer Michelle Paradise compared the scope of the finale to a feature film.\nA goal of the showrunners for the season was to \"cement Discovery firmly in the timeline\" by reconciling some of the apparent continuity errors caused by the first season, such as why Burnham has never been mentioned by Spock in the franchise before, or why the advanced spore-drive technology used on the USS Discovery is not used on other starships in later Star Trek series.\nThe season ends with Discovery and its crew traveling over 900 years into the future, and Spock recommending to Starfleet that the starship or its crew never be mentioned again to prevent the events of the season from ever being repeated.\nKurtzman said this solution was chosen after months of work with the writers, and was additionally made because of the implications it has for the future of the series; he compared the decision to the film Star Trek (2009) starting a new timeline to avoid established continuity."

      "text": "In 1868, the Irish natural scientist Edward Perceval Wright obtained several small whale shark specimens in the Seychelles.\nWright was informed of one whale shark that was actually measured as exceeding 45 ft (14 m).\nWright claimed to have observed specimens in excess of 50 ft (15 m) and was told of specimens upwards of 70 ft (21 m).\nIn a 1925 publication, Hugh M. Smith described a huge animal caught in a bamboo fish trap in Thailand in 1919.\nThe shark was too heavy to pull ashore and no measurements were taken.\nSmith learned through independent sources that it was at least 10 wa (a Thai unit of length measuring between a persons outstretched arms).\nSmith noted that one wa could be interpreted as either 2 m (6.6 ft) or the approximate average of 1.7 to 1.8 m (5.6–5.9 ft) based on the local fishermen.\nLater sources have stated this whale shark as approximately 18 m (59 ft) and the accuracy of the estimate has been questioned.\nIn 1934, a ship named the Maunganui came across a whale shark in the southern Pacific Ocean, rammed it, and the shark became stuck on the prow of the ship, supposedly with 15 ft (4.6 m) on one side and 40 ft (12.2 m) on the other, suggesting a total length of about 55 ft (17 m).\nA large specimen was caught on 11 November 1949, near Baba Island, in Karachi, Pakistan.\nIt was 11.58 m (38.0 ft) long, weighed about 19.3 t (43,000 lb), and had a girth of 7 m (23 ft).\n. In 1983 a whale shark was caught in a net off the coast of Mumbai and detailed measurements were taken from all over the body; it was found to have a total length of 12.18 m (40.0 ft) with an approximate estimated weight of 11,018 kg (24,291 lb). This was considered the largest accurately measured specimen by J. G. Coleman in 1997.\nA shark caught in 1994 off Tainan County, southern Taiwan, reportedly weighed 35.8 t (79,000 lb).\nUsing length to weight equations calculated from whale sharks, Hua Hsun Hsu and colleagues estimated two individuals reported as weighing 34 t (75,000 lb) and 42 t (93,000 lb) at 16 m (52 ft) and 17.3 m (57 ft) in length respectively.\nScott A. Eckert & Brent S. Stewart reported on satellite tracking of whale sharks from between 1994 and 1996.\nOut of the 15 individuals tracked, two females were reported as measuring 15 m (49 ft) and 18 m (59 ft) respectively.\nA whale shark was reported as being stranded in 1995, along the Ratnagiri coast, measuring 20.75 m (68.1 ft) long.\nA female individual with a standard length of 15 m (49 ft) (and an estimated total length at 18.8 m (62 ft)) was reported from the Arabian Sea in 2001.\nIn a 2015 study looking into the size of marine megafauna, McClain and colleagues considered this female as being the most reliable and accurately measured."

      "text": "In the United States, unconstitutionality is the only ground for a federal court to strike down a federal statute.\nJustice Washington, speaking for the Marshall Court, put it this way in an 1829 case:\n> We intend to decide no more than that the statute objected to in this case is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and that unless it be so, this Court has no authority, under the 25th section of the judiciary act, to re-examine and to reverse the judgement of the supreme court of Pennsylvania in the present case.\nIf a state statute conflicts with a valid federal statute, then courts may strike down the state statute as an unstatutable violation of the Supremacy Clause.\nBut a federal court may not strike down a statute absent a violation of federal law or of the federal Constitution.\nMoreover, a suspicion or possibility of unconstitutionality is not enough for American courts to strike down a statute.\nAlexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78 that the standard of review should be \"irreconcilable variance\" with the Constitution.\nAnti-federalists agreed that courts would be unable to strike down federal statutes absent a conflict with the Constitution.\nFor example, Robert Yates, writing under the pseudonym \"Brutus\", asserted that \"the courts of the general government [will] be under obligation to observe the laws made by the general legislature not repugnant to the constitution\".\nThese principles—that federal statutes can only be struck down for unconstitutionality and that the unconstitutionality must be clear—were very common views at the time of the framing of the Constitution.\nFor example, George Mason explained during the constitutional convention that judges \"could declare an unconstitutional law void. But with regard to every law, however unjust, oppressive or pernicious, which did not come plainly under this description, they would be under the necessity as Judges to give it a free course\".\nFor a number of years, the courts were relatively deferential to Congress.\nJustice Washington put it this way, in an 1827 case: \"It is but a decent respect to the wisdom, integrity, and patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond a reasonable doubt\".\nAlthough judges usually adhered to this principle that a statute could only be deemed unconstitutional in case of a clear contradiction until the twentieth century, this presumption of constitutionality weakened somewhat during the twentieth century, as exemplified by the Supreme Court's famous footnote four in United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144 (1938), which suggested that statutes may be subjected to closer scrutiny in certain types of cases.\nNevertheless, the federal courts have not departed from the principle that courts may only strike down statutes for unconstitutionality.\nOf course, the practical implication of this principle is that a court cannot strike down a statute, even if it recognizes that the statute is obviously poorly drafted, irrational, or arises from legislators' corrupt motives, unless the flaw in the statute rises to the level of a clear constitutional violation.\nIn 2008, Justice John Paul Stevens reaffirmed this point in a concurring opinion: \"[A]s I recall my esteemed former colleague, Thurgood Marshall, remarking on numerous occasions: 'The Constitution does not prohibit legislatures from enacting stupid laws'.\"\nIn the federal system, courts may only decide actual cases or controversies; it is not possible to request the federal courts to review a law without at least one party having legal standing to engage in a lawsuit.\nThis principle means that courts sometimes do not exercise their power of review, even when a law is seemingly unconstitutional, for want of jurisdiction.\nIn some state courts, such as the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, legislation may be referred in certain circumstances by the legislature or by the executive for an advisory ruling on its constitutionality prior to its enactment (or enforcement).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court seeks to avoid reviewing the Constitutionality of an act where the case before it could be decided on other grounds, an attitude and practice exemplifying judicial restraint.\nJustice Brandeis framed it thus (citations omitted):\n> The Court developed, for its own governance in the cases within its jurisdiction, a series of rules under which it has avoided passing upon a large part of all the constitutional questions pressed upon it for decision.\nThey are:\n>\n>   1.\nThe Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding, declining because to decide such questions is legitimate only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest, and vital controversy between individuals.\nIt never was the thought that, by means of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.\n>   2.\nThe Court will not anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it.\nIt is not the habit of the court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case.\n>   3.\nThe Court will not formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than required by the precise facts it applies to.\n>   4.\nThe Court will not pass upon a constitutional question although properly presented by the record, if there is also present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of ...\nIf a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter.\n>   5.\nThe Court will not pass upon the validity of a statute upon complaint of one who fails to show that he is injured by its operation.\n>   6.\nThe Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.\n>   7.\nWhen the validity of an act of the Congress is drawn in question, and even if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided."

      "text": "As a teenager, Daniel was taken in by Dan Call, a local lay preacher and moonshine distiller.\nHe began learning the distilling trade from Call and his Master Distiller, Nathan \"Nearest\" Green, an enslaved African-American man.\nGreen continued to work with Call after emancipation.\nIn 1875, on receiving an inheritance from his father's estate (following a long dispute with his siblings), Daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with Call.\nHe took over the distillery shortly afterward when Call quit for religious reasons.\nThe brand label on the product says \"Est. & Reg. in 1866\", but his biographer has cited official registration documents in asserting that the business was not established until 1875.\nAfter taking over the distillery in 1884, Daniel purchased the hollow and land where the distillery is now located.\nBy the 1880s, Jack Daniel's was one of 15 distilleries operating in Moore County, and the second-most productive behind Tom Eaton's Distillery.\nHe began using square-shaped bottles in 1897, with the square shape of the bottle intended to convey a sense of fairness and integrity.\nAccording to Daniel's biographer, the origin of the \"Old No. 7\" brand name was the number assigned to Daniel's distillery for government registration.\nHe was forced to change the registration number when the federal government redrew the district, and he became Number 16 in district 5 instead of No. 7 in district 4.\nHowever, he continued to use his original number as a brand name, since his brand reputation already had been established.\nJack Daniel's had a surge in popularity after the whiskey received the gold medal for the finest whiskey at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair.\nDaniel's local reputation was suffering as the temperance movement was gaining strength in Tennessee.\nJack Daniel never married and did not have any known children.\nHe took his nephews under his wing – one of whom was Lemuel \"Lem\" Motlow (1869–1947).\nLem, a son of Daniel's sister, Finetta, was skilled with numbers.\nHe soon was responsible for all of the distillery's bookkeeping.\nIn 1907, due to failing health, Jack Daniel gave the distillery to two of his nephews.\nMotlow soon bought out the other nephew.\nHe operated the distillery for about 40 years.\nTennessee passed a statewide prohibition law in 1910, effectively barring the legal distillation of Jack Daniel's within the state.\nMotlow challenged the law in a test case that eventually worked its way to the Tennessee Supreme Court.\nThe court upheld the law as constitutional.\nDaniel died in 1911 from blood poisoning.\nAn oft-told tale is that the infection began in one of his toes, which Daniel injured one early morning at work by kicking his safe in anger when he could not get it open (he was said to always have had trouble remembering the combination).\nBut Daniel's modern biographer has asserted that this account is not true.\nBecause of prohibition in Tennessee, the company shifted its distilling operations to St Louis, Missouri, and Birmingham, Alabama.\nNone of the production from these locations was ever sold due to quality problems.\nThe Alabama operation was halted following a similar statewide prohibition law in that state, and the St. Louis operation was halted by the onset of nationwide prohibition following passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1920.\nWhile the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933 repealed prohibition at the federal level, state prohibition laws (including Tennessee's) remained in effect, thus preventing the Lynchburg distillery from reopening.\nMotlow, who had become a Tennessee state senator, led efforts to repeal these laws, which allowed production to restart in 1938.\nThe five-year gap between national repeal and Tennessee repeal was commemorated in 2008 with a gift pack of two bottles, one for the 75th anniversary of the end of prohibition and a second commemorating the 70th anniversary of the reopening of the distillery.\nThe Jack Daniel's distillery ceased operations from 1942 to 1946 when the U.S. government banned the manufacture of whiskey due to World War II.\nMotlow resumed production of Jack Daniel's in 1947 after good-quality corn was again available.\nMotlow died the same year.\nHe bequeathed the distillery to his children, Robert, Reagor, Dan, Conner, and Mary, upon his death.\nThe company was later incorporated as \"Jack Daniel Distillery, Lem Motlow, Prop., Inc\".\nThis has allowed the company to continue to include Lem Motlow, who died in 1947, in its marketing.\nMentioning him in the advertising is technically just citing the full corporate name.\nLikewise, the advertisements continue to use Lynchburg's 1960s-era population figure of 361, though the city has since formed a consolidated city-county government with Moore County.\nIts official population is more than 6,000, according to the 2010 census.\nThe company was sold to the Brown–Forman Corporation in 1956.\nThe Jack Daniel's Distillery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\nIn 2012, a Welshman, Mark Evans, claimed to have discovered the original recipe for Daniel's whiskey, in a book written in 1853 by his great-great-grandmother.\nHer brother-in-law had emigrated to Tennessee.\nMoore County, where the Jack Daniel's distillery is located, is one of the state's many dry counties.\nWhile it is legal to distill the product within the county, it is illegal to purchase it there.\nHowever, a state law has provided one exception: a distillery may sell one commemorative product, regardless of county statutes."

      "text": "In the 12th century, under the influence of the feudal system that flourished in medieval Europe and prevailed in Hungary and Croatia, a layer of powerful noble families was formed in Croatia.\nThose families were mostly descendants of the original twelve noble Croatian tribes.\nNobility created by the monarchs or based upon royal service never existed in Croatia.\nThose nobles held and administered whole counties, presided over local courts and enforced their decisions, therefore local population was entirely separated from any state organisation.\nMost prominent Croatian noble families of the 12th and early 13th century were the House of Šubić (or Princes of Bribir), divided among various branches of the family and ruling over inland Dalmatia with their seat in Bribir; the Babonići in western Slavonia and along the right bank of the Kupa River; the Kačići between the Cetina and Neretva rivers with their seat in Omiš, known for practicing piracy; and the House of Frankopan (then known as the Princes of Krk), ruling over the island of Krk, Kvarner and the County of Modruš in northern Lika.\nBesides these main noble families there were other less powerful ones, such as the families of Gusić, Mogorović, Kukar, Lapčan and Tugomirić.\nDuring this period and as result of the Second Crusade (1145–1149), the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller gained considerable property and assets in Croatia.\nThe first grants in favor of the Christian orders were given by Bosnian Ban Borić.\nBy the end of the 12th century the Templars had possessions in Vrana, Senj, Nova Ves near Zagreb, etc.\nIn 1221 a war broke out between Domald, who was then Prince of Split and Count of Cetina, and the Šubić family over the ownership of Split.\nDomald's family ties are unknown, but he was probably from the Snačić or the Kačić family.\nDomald also held Šibenik and Klis fortress and briefly took Zadar from Venice in 1209.\nThe citizens of Split expelled Domald in 1221 and elected Višan Šubić from Zvonigrad near Knin as their prince.\nAlthough the Šubić family was victorious, another war started among its members, Gregory III Šubić of Bribir and Višan.\nGregory Šubić won, executed Višan and took his lands, thus securing supremacy in the Šubić family.\nDomald was still in possession of Klis and had ambitions to retake Split.\nIn the course of the war Domald lost Klis and then allied himself with the Kačić family.\nIn 1229 Domald managed to defeat Gregory's deputy in Split and was re-elected as the prince of Split.\nHowever, by 1231 Gregory returned to his position in Split.\nAfter Gregory died Domald took advantage of the new situation and for the second time reclaimed Split in 1235, but lost it 2 years after to Gregory's son Marko I Šubić of Bribir.\nWar with Domald was finally over when Stjepko Šubić defeated and captured him in Klis.\nCroatia and Slavonia remained decentralized under local nobles throughout the 13th century, unlike the Hungarian nobles that rebelled against King Andrew II.\nThe King was forced to issue a golden bull in 1222 defining the rights of the Hungarian nobility and granting them privileges such as tax exemption and the right to disobey the King."

Daniels, at one point, approached Jeff Probst, the host of Survivor, to appear in the finale as a moderator for the fictional reunion, although he declined. The initial table read for the episode took place on March 4, 2013. Filming commenced on March 6. According to Jenna Fischer, the episode took nine days to film, with the cast devoting 12 hours a day to the episode. The finale was described as \"ambitious\", featuring multiple location shoots, including one in an AT&T Office Building, which stood in for the Scranton Cultural Center.\nFilming for the episode and series as a whole came to an end on March 16, 2013.\nWilson later tweeted a picture of the empty set after all filming had been finished."
